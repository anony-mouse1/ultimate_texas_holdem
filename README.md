# ultimate_texas_holdem

This is just a rough draft of creating a Ultimate Texas Holdem poker game. 
For more information, search up "Ultimate Texas Holdem Rules..."
You can find the rules and regulations there. 
If using snippets of my code, please cite this repository (and file, if you wish).

Any questions can be directed to my email, and happy coding!
